</p>

<h3>Project Information</h3>
<p>
  In this project I first had to type out a proposal on two websites that I want to use.  
  After that, I had to fix any issues that the sir found and then I had to start with my actual website in HTML.
</p>

<h3>Website Goals</h3>
<p>
  The goals of this website are to raise awareness on issues such as fighting for child rights.

  <li><strong>SEO benefits</strong> – Google rewards websites that attract new and frequent visitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many ways to increase traffic to your website.</p>
