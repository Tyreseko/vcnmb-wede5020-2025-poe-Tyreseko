             <p>We aim to help as much kids as possible no matter where they be in the world. In recent years we
             have made contact with kids that live in rural areas this is ground breaking for us because over the years
            we have found it diffecult to get in contact with kids and their parents this means we can help more
             kids with issues such as health care and education.</p>  <!-- This is my second paragraph and is my introduction-->
