  The Save the Children story is and will always be one of hope and deeply passionate and committed people, 
  determined to ensure the world is a better place for all our children.
  It began with one woman who changed the worldâ€™s response to children in need.
  On the 19 May in the year 1919 a woman by the name of Eglantyne Jebb began a worldwide movement, 
  that movement was the Save the Children Fund.
</p>

<p>
  She was always driven by the belief that all children have the right to a healthy, happy and fulfilling life.
  The Save The Children fund started their work in South Africa in 1944 and their families in some of the 
  smallest and most in need communities.Save the children South Africa was formed in 2013 the fund was used to fight for local children and their rights. 
  Save the Children South Africa became an official member of the Save the Children International this is thanks to 
  the merger of many Save the Children funds such as Gauteng, Save the Children UK and Save the Children Sweden, 
  Save the Children KwaZulu-Natal.
